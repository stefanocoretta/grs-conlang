Here you can find a more detailed syllabus of the course.

Please note that I expect you to come to any week's class **prepared**, which is:

1. Having read that week's **readings** and
2. Having completed that week's **homework**, as detailed below.

**Formative assessments** are due at noon on the day of the seminar.
These are designed for you to receive feedback on parts of your conlang's reference grammar (which will be built in into your second summative assessment). Note that formative assessments are based on the topic of the previous week.

More information on formative and summative assessments can be found on the [Assessment](assessment.html) page.


## Week 1

There is no class on Week 1.

## Week 2: Conlanging and the languages of the world

## Readings

-   [Conlanging 101](https://conlang.org/26c3.pdf) by Sai Emrys, Alex Fink and David Peterson.
    -   An introduction to *conlanging*, the art of constructing artificial languages.
-   The Language Construction Kit (LCK), Ch *The overall process*.
    -   The LCK is the go-to book to teach yourself how to build a *conlang* from scratch. The Chapter *The overall process* gives you an overview of the entire conlanging process.
-   Croft, Bill. 2003. *Typology and universals*. Ch 1.
    -   Classical book on linguistic typology (and typological linguistics). The first chapter introduces you to typological linguistics. Pay special attention to the *problem of cross-linguistic variability*.
-   Aikhenvald, Alexandra. 2014. *The art of grammar: A practical guide*. Ch 1.
    -   Writing a reference grammar is an art and a science in itself. This textbook covers the main practical aspects of how to go about writing a grammar. Chapter one focusses on what a reference grammar is and its structure and offers guidance on linguistic analysis and argumentation.

## Homework

-   Pick a language you are curious about and find a descriptive grammar of that language in the library.
-   You can choose any language, except "big" languages like English, Spanish, Mandarin, Japanese, Arabic, French, German, ... (what's the fun in that!).
-   Remember to bring the descriptive grammar to class.

## Formative 1: Language context

Submit **one or two paragraphs of language context** for your conlang. Remember to give a name to your conlang (you can change this later).

- A *language context article* can include "information about speaker demography, social organisation, culture, linguistic ecology, language vitality, and language use and transmission in the local community, its diaspora and the Internet, discussion of the range of languages/varieties in use by speakers, including socio-cultural factors affecting language/variety choice".
- A more detailed description of language context articles can be found here: <http://www.elpublishing.org/about-language-contexts>. Remember that you are supposed to **write only one or two paragraphs**.
- To find inspiration, check the language context papers at <http://www.elpublishing.org/language-contexts>.
