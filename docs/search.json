    "text": "Course description\nIn this seminar, you will learn about linguistic diversity and typology of a variety of structures at many linguistic levels (phonology, morphology, syntax, etc) through the process of creating a constructed language, or conlang.\nThe seminar is built around the task of crafting a conlang from the ground up while researching common and rare linguistic patterns as found in the languages of the world. With the typological knowledge you will acquire by consulting grammars and linguistic overviews, you will learn how to put together a basic grammar for your own conlang and how to write a grammar sketch.\nThe seminar will be assessed on the basis of the grammar sketch of your designed conlang, including a short written passage in your conlang accompanied by interlinear glossing. See the Assesment page for details."

    "text": "Cu is a constructed language for a fictional situation in which a deific snake has created mankind and has given them the gift of language. Cu is a descendent of a language that’s much more restricted by serpentine vocal anatomy that has humanised over time. Since snakes can’t produce many different types of sounds, the proto-language phonology was impoverished, and was characterised by low information-density strings of difficult-to-pronounce fricative clusters. As the language has humanised, the phonology has expanded, with more places and manners of articulation, as well as statistically common features like voicing, which has allowed the language to become more efficient. This culminates as a still very snake-like language that has strayed quite far from its roots. A primary creative feature of the language is its extensive polysynthesis, that requires all clauses to be a single word.\n\n  θsȧmȧCḁ̇chxciȧtsaCiȧθȧkrȧkhk\n  θ- sȧ -mȧ- -Cḁ̇ -chxci -ȧtsa- -Ci -ȧθȧ- -krȧkhk\n  PST- COP -TRANS- -Cḁ̇ -scared -DAT- -Cu -GEN- -safety\n  'Cḁ became fearful for the Cu’s safety,'\n\n\n\n  θaknknascfulumahθlucksaθstsuschmtʃuʃlakhc.\n  θa- ∅- knkn- a- scfuluma- h- θ- lucksa -∅ -θstsuschm -tʃu -ʃlakhc\n  CONJ- ACC- wall- ACT- DEFR- PFV- PST- create -NOM- -3SG.ANI.DEFR -INSTR- -body\n  'so they created a wall from their body.'\n\n\nGrammar (PDF)"

This agglutinative language has SOV word order and has—as is common among Bantu languages—more than 15 noun classes. Other idiosyncratic features of the language are best understood in a sociocultural context and are based on the people’s respect for nature (through lexeme families and figures of speech rooted in the four elements), respect for each other (through inter-generational rules for click consonant deformation), and attention to individuals’ perceptions (through emotions modifying the click consonant usage, possession of emotions being expressed using inalienable possession and verb tenses being dedicated to the people’s spiritual past/future).\nThe conlang is a product of a computer scientist’s (Verna Dankers’) research into the languages of mid- and southern Africa and captures many linguistic features that are lost when considering digitalising language as mere text without considering the contexts in which languages are embedded.\nThe example below showcases certain features of Nimivefati, by illustrating subject drop (the subject of ‘to know’ can be unambiguously inferred from the verb), including nouns from two classes (classes 1 and 9), using one of the click consonants /ᶢǀ/, employing a fire-related metaphor, and using the Imaginary Past} impst tense for ‘to burn’:\n\n  mu-piku Ø-pikobiamɔna ŋi-mu-tái-iŋi-Ø-mēki mi-Ø-ᶢǀuja \n  NP1-man NP9-earth 3SG.SBJ-NP1-IMPST}-3SG.OBJ-NP9-burn 1SG.SBJ-PRS-know\n  'I know that man burnt the earth.
