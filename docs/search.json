    "text": "Cu is a constructed language for a fictional situation in which a deific snake has created mankind and has given them the gift of language. Cu is a descendent of a language that’s much more restricted by serpentine vocal anatomy that has humanised over time. Since snakes can’t produce many different types of sounds, the proto-language phonology was impoverished, and was characterised by low information-density strings of difficult-to-pronounce fricative clusters. As the language has humanised, the phonology has expanded, with more places and manners of articulation, as well as statistically common features like voicing, which has allowed the language to become more efficient. This culminates as a still very snake-like language that has strayed quite far from its roots. A primary creative feature of the language is its extensive polysynthesis, that requires all clauses to be a single word.\n\n  θsȧmȧCḁ̇chxciȧtsaCiȧθȧkrȧkhk\n  θ- sȧ -mȧ- -Cḁ̇ -chxci -ȧtsa- -Ci -ȧθȧ- -krȧkhk\n  PST- COP -TRANS- -Cḁ̇ -scared -DAT- -Cu -GEN- -safety\n  'Cḁ became fearful for the Cu’s safety,'\n\n\n\n  θaknknascfulumahθlucksaθstsuschmtʃuʃlakhc.\n  θa- ∅- knkn- a- scfuluma- h- θ- lucksa -∅ -θstsuschm -tʃu -ʃlakhc\n  CONJ- ACC- wall- ACT- DEFR- PFV- PST- create -NOM- -3SG.ANI.DEFR -INSTR- -body\n  'so they created a wall from their body.'\n\n\nGrammar (PDF)"

    "text": "Nimivefati is a hypothetical Bantu language spoken by a tribe that lives near the Congo River basin. This agglutinative language has SOV word order and has—as is common among Bantu languages—more than 15 noun classes. Other idiosyncratic features of the language are best understood in a sociocultural context and are based on the people’s respect for nature (through lexeme families and figures of speech rooted in the four elements), respect for each other (through inter-generational rules for click consonant deformation), and attention to individuals’ perceptions (through emotions modifying the click consonant usage, possession of emotions being expressed using inalienable possession and verb tenses being dedicated to the people’s spiritual past/future).\nThe conlang is a product of a computer scientist’s (Verna Dankers’) research into the languages of mid- and southern Africa and captures many linguistic features that are lost when considering digitalising language as mere text without considering the contexts in which languages are embedded.\nThe example below showcases certain features of Nimivefati, by illustrating subject drop (the subject of ‘to know’ can be unambiguously inferred from the verb), including nouns from two classes (classes 1 and 9), using one of the click consonants /ᶢǀ/, employing a fire-related metaphor, and using the Imaginary Past} impst tense for ‘to burn’:\n\n  mu-piku Ø-pikobiamɔna ŋi-mu-tái-iŋi-Ø-mēki mi-Ø-ᶢǀuja \n  NP1-man NP9-earth 3SG.SBJ-NP1-IMPST}-3SG.OBJ-NP9-burn 1SG.SBJ-PRS-know\n  'I know that man burnt the earth.

    "text": "Cjordan is a regional language and the mother tongue of some three thousand members of a nomadic trading community. Cjordan speakers originate from the Larekian empire, more specifically from a landlocked valley eastern of a mountain range located in the centre of the Ademoja region, a fictional Lapland. A Finnic language, Cjordan exhibits similar patterns to Finnish and Estonian such as its lack of grammatical gender, agglutinative nature, morphological derivation, and its productivity through compounding. Cjordan mainly revolves around trade, time, craft, family, and travel, due to the nature of the speakers’ lives as nomadic individuals.\n\n  Oita marenomuneg jad omjetokatet bjo Ademojane!\n  oita marenomuneg-∅ jad omjet-o-katet bjo Ademoja-ne\n  hello traveller-NOM.SG and be.PRS.2SG-EPEN-IMP.2SG good Ademoja-INE\n  'Hello traveller, and welcome in Ademoja!'\n\n\nGrammar (PDF)"

The main idea was to create a language that relies heavily on the speakers’ shared knowledge and their cultural understanding, a language where not much is said and lots is implied, something you could get away with in a close-knit community. The result is an agglutinative language with a relatively simple grammar, but lots of optionality when it comes to argument structure.\n\n  Mmota nnuyenni yaliseka\n  mmo-ta nnuyen-ni yaliseka\n  1SG-S rain-O hear\n  'I hear the rain.'\n\n\n\n  Nnuyenni yaliseka\n  nnuyen-ni yaliseka\n  rain-O hear\n  'The rain, I hear.'\n\n\n\n  Mmo nnuyen yaliseka\n  mmo nnuyen yaliseka\n  1SG rain hear\n  'I hear the rain.'\n\n\nGrammar (PDF)"
