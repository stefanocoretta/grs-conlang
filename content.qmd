Here you can find a week-by-week breakdown of the course.

Please note that I expect you to come to every class **prepared**, which mean:s

1.  You have read that week's **readings** and
2.  You have completed that week's **homework tasks** and/or thought about the week's **questions**, as detailed below.

**Formative assessments** are due at noon on the day of the seminar. These are designed for you to receive feedback on parts of your conlang's grammar. Note that each formative assessment is based on the topic of the previous week.

More information on **formative and summative assessments** can be found on the [Assessment](assessment.qmd) page.

The [**reading list**]{.underline} for this seminar can be found [here](https://eu01.alma.exlibrisgroup.com/leganto/public/44UOE_INST/lists/38657069480002466?auth=SAML).

## Week 1

There is no class in Week 1.

## Week 2: Conlanging and the languages of the world

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
### Readings

-   [Conlanging 101](https://conlang.org/26c3.pdf) by Sai Emrys, Alex Fink and David Peterson.
    -   An introduction to *conlanging*, the art of constructing artificial languages.
-   The Language Construction Kit (LCK), Ch *The overall process*.
    -   The LCK is the go-to book to teach yourself how to build a *conlang* from scratch. The Chapter *The overall process* gives you an overview of the entire conlanging process.

The following are readings that you can skim through in Week 1 and read at your own time throughout the course.

-   Croft, Bill. 2003. *Typology and universals*. Ch 1.
    -   Classical book on linguistic typology (and typological linguistics). The first chapter introduces you to typological linguistics. Pay special attention to the *Problem of cross-linguistic variability*.
-   Aikhenvald, Alexandra. 2014. *The art of grammar: A practical guide*. Ch 1.
    -   Writing a reference grammar is an art and a science in itself. This textbook covers the main practical aspects of how to go about writing a grammar. Chapter 1 focusses on what a reference grammar is and its structure and offers guidance on linguistic analysis and argumentation.

### Homework - Adopt a language

**Pick a language you are curious about and find a descriptive grammar of that language through the library (either digital or print).**

-   You can choose any language, except "big" languages like English, Spanish, Mandarin, Japanese, Arabic, French, German, ... (what's the fun in that!). I strongly recommend you to pick languages from language families you are the least familiar with.
-   Find inspiration on Glottolog: <https://glottolog.org>.
-   **Go to Piazza (link on Learn) and make a new note** with name of the language, language family, location, features of interest, why you picked that language.

## Week 3: Sound systems

::: {.callout-important collapse="true"}
### Formative 1: Language context

Submit **one or two paragraphs of language context** for your conlang. Remember to give a name to your conlang (you can change this later).

-   A *language context article* can include "information about speaker demography, social organisation, culture, linguistic ecology, language vitality, and language use and transmission in the local community, its diaspora and the Internet, discussion of the range of languages/varieties in use by speakers, including socio-cultural factors affecting language/variety choice".
-   A more detailed description of language context articles can be found here: <http://www.elpublishing.org/about-language-contexts>. Remember that you are supposed to **write only one or two paragraphs**.
-   To find inspiration, check the language context papers at <http://www.elpublishing.org/language-contexts>.
