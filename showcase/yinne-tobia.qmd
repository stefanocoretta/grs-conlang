**Yinne** was originally created as part of the world-building for a story set in a distant future where humans have colonised space, but still lack the technology for hyper-speed, so travel between different settlements is a lengthy and difficult endeavour, and many settlements are very isolated communities. The main idea was to create a language that relies heavily on the speakers' shared knowledge and their cultural understanding, a language where not much is said and lots is implied, something you could get away with in a close-knit community. The result is an agglutinative language with a relatively simple grammar, but lots of optionality when it comes to argument structure.
