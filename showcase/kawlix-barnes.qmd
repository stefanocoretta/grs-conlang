**Kawlix** (endonym: *moamaj kawlix*) is spoken by the Kawli people who lived in first century CE central Highland Scotland. The language has no known relatives at the time considered, although Kawli tradition suggest there may have been speakers of related languages in the past (at least several generations ago). Kawlix tends towards agglutinative morphology, while an unusual feature of the language is ergative-absolutive alignment in the syntax as well as the morphology/case system.
