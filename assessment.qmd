## Overview

This course will be assessed on the basis of a **set of formative assessments** and **two summative assessments**.

**Formative assessments** are assessments for which you might receive feedback on, but which will not be marked. These will give you a chance to keep on track with the course contents and get interim feedback (or *feedforward*) that will better prepare you for the summative assessments.

You will have to submit two **summative assessments**. These assessments will be marked and the final mark will be based on those marks (the weighting is different depending on which version of the course you are taking).

-   **Summative assessment 1 (SA1)**: Sketch grammar draft

    -   **Word limit**: 1500. 50% over is allowed.

    -   **Due date: Thursday 17 November 2022 at noon (Week 8).**

-   **Summative assessment 2 (SA2)**: Sketch grammar and glossed text

    -   **Word limit**: 2500 (UG, PG 10 credits); 4000 (PG 20 credits). 15% over is allowed.

    -   Due date: Thursday 15 December 2022 at noon (Week 13).

**1500 words ±30%.**

-   Based on **Weeks 2-5**.
-   You should submit a **draft of the sketch grammar of the conlang** you are creating. The draft should contain at least the following sections:
    -   **Language context**.
    -   **Phonology**.
    -   **Lexicon** (for example, overview of word classes).
-   What you are expected to include in the section is the same as with the corresponding formative assessments, so please refer to the instructions of those on the [Syllabus](syllabus.html) page.
-   Furthermore, you are expected to follow writing style and formatting conventions as used in the field of linguistics. A good summary of most of these can be found in the [Generic Style Rules for Linguistics](https://www.eva.mpg.de/lingua/pdf/GenericStyleRules.pdf).
