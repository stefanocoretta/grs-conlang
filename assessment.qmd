## Overview

This course will be assessed on the basis of a **set of formative assessments** and **two summative assessment**.

**Formative assessments** are assessments for which you might receive feedback on, but which will not be marked. These will give you a chance to keep on track with the course contents and get interim feedback that will better prepare you for the summative assessment.

You will have to submit two **summative assessments**. These assessments will be marked and the final mark will be based on those marks (the weighting is different depending on which version of the course you are taking).
